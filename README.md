# RISC-V CPU Project

## Makerchip Project Link : https://makerchip.com/sandbox/073fmhqpA/0r0h8Ar#

## Overview

This project aims to build a RISC-V CPU capable of executing instructions to perform basic arithmetic operations. Initially, the primary goal was to create a processor that could count the first 10 natural numbers using the ADDI (Add immediate) instruction. Subsequently, additional instructions were implemented to enhance functionality.

The CPU is developed using TL-Verilog Language on Makerchip software, facilitating efficient design and simulation.

## Implementation Steps

The implementation of the RISC-V CPU proceeded through the following steps:

1. **PC Logic:** Completed
2. **Instruction Memory:** Completed
3. **Decode Logic:** In Progress
4. **Register File Read**
5. **Arithmetic Logic Unit**
6. **Register File Write**
7. **Branch Logic**
8. **Jump Logic**
9. **Load, Store, and Data Memory**

## Benefits of Makerchip Software

Makerchip software offers several advantages for developing and testing digital designs:

- **Organized Diagrams:** Designs are represented in logic diagrams. TL-Verilog design hierarchy, including pipelines and pipeline stages, provides organization to your logic diagrams. Below, the path through $ANY ovals shows the flow a transaction will follow through an example design.
- **Organized Waveforms:** Waveforms are organized by TL-Verilog design hierarchy. Waveforms clearly show when signals are carrying meaningful data.
- **Signal Randomization:** Facilitates thorough testing by generating randomized signals for comprehensive simulation scenarios.
- **Tool Integration:**Makerchip can easily be launched as a Verilog/TL-Verilog editor from other applications. For example, Makerchip provides the digital side of FOSSEE's mixed-signal eSim environment, and SandPiper-SaaS provides eSim's TL-Verilog compilation. It also provides Verilog code for better understanding after compilation of TL-VerilogÂ code.
